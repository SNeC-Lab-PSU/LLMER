# LLMER: Crafting Interactive Extended Reality Worlds with JSON Data Generated by Large Language Models

Welcome to the repository for **LLMER: Crafting Interactive Extended Reality Worlds with JSON Data Generated by Large Language Models**. This repository contains the implementation for the methods and experiments described in our paper.

We are excited to open source our implementation for **academic and non-commercial use**, enabling the community to explore and extend our work.

**Note**: This implementation is currently in a **preliminary stage** and intended for **prototype use only**. Future updates may expand its functionality and robustness.

---

## Availability
The open-sourced scripts and assets in this repository will be made publicly available after **IEEE VR 2025**, scheduled for **March 8 to 12, 2025**.

Feel free to contact us for **early access** if you are interested in collaborating or exploring the implementation ahead of the public release.

We appreciate your patience and look forward to sharing the implementation with the broader community following the presentation.
